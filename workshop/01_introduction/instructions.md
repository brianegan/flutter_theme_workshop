# Introduction

Welcome to the _**Consistent design with Flutter Theme**_ workshop by [Anna Leushchenko 👩‍💻💙📱🇺🇦](https://github.com/foxanna)!

>Consistency is a winning strategy for a good application UI. And Flutter developers don’t have to be professional designers to achieve it. As usual, there is a widget for that - `Theme`! Find more details about effortless consistent Flutter application design in this workshop.

This workshop only assumes knowledge of commonly used Flutter widgets like `Text`, `ElevatedButton`, `TextField`, etc., so everyone is welcomed!
